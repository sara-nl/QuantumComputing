    "Measuring in different bases allows us to also witness Heisenbergâ€™s famous \"uncertainty principle\" in action. Having certainty of measuring a state in the Z-basis removes all certainty of measuring a specific state in the X-basis, and vice versa. A common misconception is that the uncertainty is due to the limits in our equipment, here we can see the uncertainty is actually part of the nature of the qubit.\n",

Similarly, if we put our qubit in the state $|-\\rangle$, our measurement in the X-basis is certain to be $|-\\rangle$ but now any measurement in the Z-basis will be completely random."
