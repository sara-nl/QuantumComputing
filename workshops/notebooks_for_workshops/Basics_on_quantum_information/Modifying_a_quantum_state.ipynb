    "\n",
    "As we previously mentioned, the state of a qubit can be represented as a point (vector) in Bloch sphere. Different points in the sphere represent different qubit states. It is there rather intuitively that if we want to modify the state of a qubit, we need a way of moving the the point in Bloch's Sphere. Movements within a shhere can be done by rotating and reflecting the vector associated to the point. Mathematically, the rotation and reflection of a vector can be achieved by multiplying the vector by a rotation or reflection matrix. In quanutm computing a \"gate\" is an operation that modifies the state of a qubit. We know, that such operations are matrices. In particular in order to be consider a gate, the matrix most be unitary and have the same number of input and output qubits.\n",
    "The action of a gate on a specific qubit state is then determined by multiplying the statevector $|\\psi\\rangle$ which represents the qubit state by the matrix $U$ representing the gate.\n",

    "On the very left, the individual qubit. From there on to the right, there is a line, called a wire, that describes the evolution of the qubit during computation. On this wire, one can apply unitary operations at a certain point, by means of quantum gates. Finally, the state is measured. We will talk about this in the next section.\n",
