    "Many quantum gates can be expressed as a composition of other gates, hence not all gates are needed in a quantum computer. The minimum set of gates needed to represent all operations is called a \"universal gate set\" or in other words, any set of gates to which any operation possible on a quantum computer can be reduced is a universal gate set. One example of a universal gate set is  {H, Rz, CNOT} (we will explore the CNOT gate in a bit).\n",
