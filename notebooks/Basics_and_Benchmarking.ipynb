    "In recent years quantum computing has become a buzzword and the possibility of a fully working quantum computer is becoming closer and closer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both, quantum knowledge and technology have grown exponentially fast, even faster than classical computing in its early years, but still developing a non-trivial size quantum computer is not straight forward. We will probably have to wait some more years to witness their full power and applicability (although IBM has announced their roadmap with 1000+ qubits by the end of 2023!. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum computers available nowadays (eg. IBM, Google, QuTech, etc.) are what we call \"Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices\" (NISQ). They are quantum computers capable of executing quantum algorithms and calculations but where the sources of errors limits how reliable they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "NISQ devices can be benchmarked using the \"quantum volume\" (introduced by IBM), which takes into account not only the number of qubits (called the width of a circuit) but also the number of operations (called the depth of a circuit) a quantum computer can handle. The depth of a circuit, is influenced by things such as the number of qubits, how qubits are interconnected, gate and measurement errors, device cross talk, circuit compiler efficiency, and more.\n",
    "Therefore, it is a good indicator of the relative complexity of problems that can be solved by a quantum computer. The larger the number, the more powerful the quantum computer is  and the higher the potential for exploring solutions to real world problems across industry, government, and research is. More info can be found at https://medium.com/qiskit/what-is-quantum-volume-anyway-a4dff801c36f\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical simulation of quantum computation is vital for the study of new algorithms and architectures. As experimental researchers move closer to realising quantum computers of sufficient complexity to be useful, their work must be guided by an understanding of what tasks we can hope to perform. This in turn means we must explore an algorithm’s scaling, its robustness versus errors and imperfections, and the relevance of limitations of the underlying hardware. Because of these requirements simulation tools are needed on many different classical architectures; while a workstation may be sufficient for the initial stages of examining an algorithm, further study of scaling and robustness may require more powerful computational resources. Flexible, multi-platform supporting simulators of quantum computers are therefore essential. Quantum simulators, allow quantum algorithm designers to simulate the execution of their quantum circuits on a quantum computer. The simulator defines a low-level quantum assembly language namely Quantum Code which allows the users to describe their circuits in a simple textual source code file. The source code file is then used as the input of the simulator which executes its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further it is important these simulations are very efficient since they are often repeated many times, for example to study the influence of many parameters, or the behaviour of circuits under noise. But it is expensive to exactly simulate a quantum system using a classical system, since a high-dimensional complex vector must be maintained with high fidelity. Both the memory requirements, and the time required to simulate an elementary circuit operation, grow exponentially with the number of qubits. To simulate quantum computers even of the size already experimentally realised, it is necessary that a classical simulator take full advantage of the performance optimisations possible of high performance classical computing.\n",

    "## Basics on Quantum information\n",
    "Information in a quantum computer is stored in qubits.\n",
    "A qubit is a two state system with quantum properties, this means that as opposed to a bit that can only be in state 0 or 1 (on or off), a state of a qubit (denoted $|\\psi>$) can be in a combination (superposition) of the two states (called basis states),\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\psi> = \\alpha|0> + \\beta|1>$\n",
    "\n",
    "The qubit is not 0 or 1 (on or off), but a little bit of both (like a dimmy light). How on or how off depends on the coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ (called probability amplitudes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we measure a qubit there are two possible outcomes: 0 or 1 (the basis states of the measurment), but when the qubit is measured we \"force\" it to collapse into one of them. For the example above, the probability of measuring one state or the other (|0> or |1>) depends on how they contribute to the total state in the first place: depends on the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The larger the magnitud of the probability amplitud the more likely it is we measure the associated state (as a side note, this values can also be negative!). The probability of actually measuring state |0> is given by $|\\alpha|^2$ and the probability of measuring state |1> is $|\\beta|^2$. Since the total probability of measuring one state has to be 1.0, we also know that $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above, it is not surprising that as opposed to a classical bit which can be described by only one number: 0 or 1, a qubit needs two (complex) numbers to be fully described: the probability amplitudes. A qubit can be fully described as a 2D vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "           \\alpha \\\\\n",
    "           \\beta \\\\\n",
    "           \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general however, a quantum computer does not consist of one qubit but many qubits interacting among them (how and which of them can interact depends on the topology of the actual hardware). The state of a quantum computer ($|\\psi>$) is therefore a combination of these qubit states and hence a combination of the basis states of the n-qubit system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of basis states of a system increases with the number of qubits as $2^n$ (n=number qubits) and hence the state of the quantum computer with n-qubits is fully described by a vector with $2^n$ entries (the probability amplitudes of the basis states of all qubits).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a system of 2-qubits each qubit can be in state |0> or |1>, this means that a 2-qubit system can  be measured in states |00>, |01>, |10> or |11> (so all possible permutations). These are the basis states. Before measuring, the 2-qubit system can be any combination of this basis states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\psi> = \\alpha|00> + \\beta|01> +\\gamma|10> +\\delta|11>$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and can be fully represented by the vector $[\\alpha, \\beta,\\gamma, \\delta]^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying a quanutm state means modifiying the probability amplitudes that describe it (the entries in the above vector). Measurments are a type of operation that do this. They \"turn\" all probability amplitudes to zero, except for one, which will have a value of 1.0 (basically they project the quantum state into one of the basis states). \n",
    "There are however many other operations that can modify the entries of such a \"quantum state\" vector and hence the quantum state of an n-qubit system. \n",
    "These operations (called quantum gates) can be used to manipulate the quantum state into a given outcome, hence we can use them to create algorithms. A quantum algorithm is just a sequence of gates with a given prupose. \n",
    "A quantum gate can be represented as $2^n$x$2^n$ unitary matrix (n the number of qubits in the system). The application of quantum gates to qubits corresponds to the multiplication of the n-qubit quantum state vector with the quantum gate matrix and results in a modification of the $2^n$ of the quantum state vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some gates are comparable to classical gates. For example the classical NOT gate can be compared to the quantum X gate. In classical computing the NOT-gate converts a 0 into a 1 and a 1 into a 0. The quantum X-gate swaps the probability amplitudes of both states and converts $|\\psi> = \\alpha |0> + \\beta|1>$ into $|\\psi>= \\beta|0> + \\alpha|0>$, which basically means the probability of measuring 0 or 1 is swap when we apply the X gate.\n",
    "For more examples of quantum gates we refer the reader to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate. For a more indepth knowledge of quantum gates we recommend for example: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.2998.pdf. How these gates are physically implemented depends on the type of qubits: trapped ions, NV centers, photons, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most quantum gates act only in a small number of qubits (mostly due to experimental limitations).This is not a limitation as there exist sets of one- and two-qubit quantum gates which are universal for quantum computation: any operation possible on a quantum computer can be reduced to this set of gates. Interestingly, this also means that most gates can be computationally represented by relatively sparse matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "One classification of quantum gates is the Clifford vs non-Clifford gates(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_gates). The Clifford gates are important, because a universal gate set consists of all the Clifford gates plus one non-Clifford gate. The Clifford-gates include the Pauli-gates (I, X, Y and Z), the Hadamard gate, the S gate and the controlled-X gate. The non-Clifford gate group is an infinite group with all the other quantum gates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clifford gates are interesting for quantum simulators because they can be simulated in polynomial time, while non-Clifford gates are exponentially hard to simulate on a classical computers (Gottesman-Knill theorem). For more information about the Gottesman-Knill theorem, reading \"Improved Simulation of Stabilizer Circuits\" by Scott Aaronson and Daniel Gottesman (Aaronson and Gottesman, 2004) is recommended. Inn practice this allows one to simulate circuits with  thousands  of  qubits.   It  also  means  that  a quantum computer will need to use gates outside of theClifford  group  in  order  to  achieve  useful  speedups  overclassical computation.  The full power of quantum computation can be recovered by adding a single non-Cliffordgate to the Clifford group. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Benchmarking quantum simulators<a id='quantumsim'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, a quantum simulator is a program that simulates how a quantum computer works; the exact calculation of the effects of every single gate on the qubits. Quantum simulators are used to increase and facilitate the development of quantum algorithms, their testing and debugging while non-trivial size quantum computer become available. They also allow for hardware-software co-design (Haner et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06460).\n",
    "The need of quantum simulators has lead to the development of many different frameworks and libraries (for a reasonably complete list we refer the reader to https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/list-qc-simulators), which rises the question: **which one should we use for a given problem?** Beyond understanding the different capabilitites of the softwares and libraries it is important to understand their functionality and performance in order to chose the most appropiate one for a given application/problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum simulators can differ from one an other on how the quantum state is stored, what gates are implemented, how measurments are performed, type of error sources that can be included, etc. These differences make it difficult to define a benchmark. \n",

    "One of the main issues with quantum simulators are their limitations: they are normally memory bound and network bandwith limited. Trying to classically simulate a quantum system is very expensive... which is why we want quantum computers!\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, the size of the quantum states and quantum gates scales exponentially with the number of qubits. This also implies that the time and memory it takes to create them and operate with them in a classical computer in general scales exponentially, which of course limits the amount of qubits we can currently simulate in a computer. With this in mind, it is interesting to compare how the execution time and memory requirements scale with the number of qubits and depth (number of operations) of the circuit for the different quantum simulators, so basically how complex can the algorithms we want to simulate be. \n",
    "\n",
    "In previous papers (Jones et al., 2018) random circuits have been used to benchmark the performance of quantum simulators. Here, we will follow the same approach. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Random circuits<a id='randomcircuits'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, given a quantum system of n-qubits, there is a continuous set of possible states: all of the different combination of the $2n$ basis states (different values of the probability amplitudes). \n",
    "The capacity of exploring and operating in all states is what quantum computers are all about. Classically this could take many many computational hours, months, even years, but using the quantum properties of the system this can be done very efficiently. An interesting question however is: how can we check we are exploring all states? One way of assesing this is by randomly producing n-qubit states and verifying that they are picked uniformly. \n",
    "This task although possible is also not straight forward for a quantum computer, the reason behind this is that most of the possible states are what we call \"entangled states\". Entangled states are not only difficult to create (assuming the standard set of single qubit rotations and two or three qubits entangling gates) but also highly unstable: they tend to decohere quickly due to interactions with an outside environment, which essentially drives the qubits to an unentangled states (like all qubits |0>). \n",
    "\n",
    "This can however be done by running random circuits of sufficient circuit depth. Random quantum circuits are circuits that can generate quantum random states: when fed a constant input, they produce a random quantum state in each execution. Executing it many times yields a sample of quantum states that contains fresh randomness inherent to the quantum evaluation. So, how do we generate quantum random states? As in the classical case, we need to randomly evolve the input quantum state. In the case of quantum, this needs to be understood in terms of random unitary transformations: we need to contruct random unitary transformation. The simplest way of achieving this is by selecting single and two-qubit gates from a universal gate set. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling the output distribution of a random  quantum circuit is a hard computational task and hence not possible with a classical computer. The randomness of the process ensures that there are no nice properties that could be exploited by a classical simulation. So the task of simulating arbitrary random circuits will require a full simulation of the n-qubits, and therefore the required classical resources will scale exponentially with $n$. \n",
    "In short, the output distribution of strings cannot be simulated in a short amount of time by a classical computer. This is basically what Google proved in their 2019 experiment of \"quantum supremacy\" using 53 qubits.\n",

    "An other important multi qubit gate is the Toffoli gate. The Toffoli gate is a three-qubit gate with two controls and one target. It performs an X on the target only if both controls are in the state |1>. The final state of the target is then equal to either the AND or the NAND of the two controls, depending on whether the initial state of the target was |0> or |1>. A Toffoli can also be thought of as a controlled-controlled-NOT, and is also called the CCX gate."

    "A random circuit contains  a  random  sequence  of  gates from a given set. Here we will follow the algorithm from https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00263 to generate the random circuits. The topology is fixed (a linear array or a grid depending on 1D or 2D) for a given depth and number of qubits, but it randomises the sequence of single qubit gates. The total number of gates goes like $O(n*d), d=$depth of circuit and the ratio between single and control gates is fixed to 1.2 $\\pm$ 0.2\n",
    "\n",
    "The general algorithm goes as follow:\n",
    "- Start with a cycle of Hadmards \n",
    "- Follow by some controlled-phase (CZ) gates \n",
    "- Folow by single-qubit gates chosen at random from the set {X1/2,Y1/2,T} at all qubits that are not occupied by the CZ gates at the same cycle (subject to the restrictions below). \n",
    "\n",
    "Single-qubit gates are placed subject to the following rules:\n",
    "- Place a gate at qubit q only if this qubit is occupied by a CZ gate in the previous cycle\n",
    "- Place  a  T  gate  at  qubit q if there are no single-qubit gates in the previous cycles at qubit q except for the initial cycle of Hadamard gates.\n",
    "- Any  gate  at  qubit q should be different from the gate at qubit q in the previous cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "As a brief background, if we think of the probability amplitudes of a single qubit as a vector in a 3D sphere, all single qubit gates modify the vector by rotating it in the \"Bloch\" sphere. The X gate rotates it 180 degrees. The T-gate is a single qubit 45 degree shift and the X1/2(Y1/2) are a $\\pi/2= 90^\\circ$ rotations around the X(Y) axis in the Bloch sphere. The Controlled Z (CZ) is a two-qubit gate and is the controlled version of the Z gate (same as CNOT being the controlled version of the X-gate). This gate applies a Z operation (change of sign in the |1> state) on the target qubit when the control is |1>. It can also be described as a conditional operation that performs a sign shift only when the two qubit state is |11>.\n",

    "To further develop quantum algorithms it is necessary to have quantum software. Already there are a lot of different quantum software and libraries, therefore it would be great to look at the performances of some libraries. In this notebook we saw that a lot of research papers use random circuits to benchmark quantum and with quantum software and libraries most compare the time and memory it takes to execute a circuit. The problem with quantum simulators is that there are a lot and they are all different, this means it is difficult to compare these software and libraries with each other in a benchmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we have looked at the two python libraries Qiskit and Qulacs. These libraries have been chosen, because they are different from each other and interesting for researchers. Qiskit is a full-stack library with a lot of documentation and beginners guides, Qulacs is said to run fast and can run on a GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the benchmarks in this notebook the conclusion is that Qulacs for circuits with 20 or less qubits the fastest is, because it compresses circuits to simulate them faster. But Qiskit is best for using Clifford gates on more then 20 qubits. Qulacs uses more maximum resident set size then Qiskit. "
