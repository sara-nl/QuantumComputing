    "## 1.1 Qubits and their representation <a id ='qubits'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Information in a quantum computer is stored in qubits.\n",
    "A qubit is a two state system with quantum properties. As opposed to a bit that can only be in state 0 or 1 (on or off), a qubit can have any value in between (like a dimmy light): a qubit can be in a combination (superposition) of the \"basis states\" $|0>$ and $|1>$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\psi> = \\alpha|0> + \\beta|1>$  \n",
    "\n",
    "$| \\psi >$ (the state vector) is the sum of the two basis states:\n",
    "\n",
    "The qubit can not only have the value of $0$ or $1$ (on or off), but can be in any state in between (like a dimmy light). How on or how off depends on the coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ (called probability amplitudes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we measure a qubit there are two possible outcomes: 0 or 1 (the basis states of the measurment), but when the qubit is measured we \"force\" it to collapse into one of this states. For the example above, the probability of measuring one state or the other (|0> or |1>) depends on how they contribute to the total state in the first place: depends on the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The larger the magnitud of the probability amplitud the more likely it is we measure the associated state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actual probability of measuring state |0> is given by $|\\alpha|^2$ and the actual probability of measuring state |1> is $|\\beta|^2$ ($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ can also be negative or complex numbers!). Since the total probability of measuring a state has to be 1.0, we also know that $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to a classical bit, which can be described by only one number: 0 or 1, for a qubit we have to specify the basis states (if not the default) and two (complex) numbers: the probability amplitude. Therefore, once the basis set is given, a qubit can be fully described as a 2D vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "           \\alpha \\\\\n",
    "           \\beta \\\\\n",
    "           \\end{bmatrix} \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in their general form are of the type : $a+ib$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Multiple qubits <a id ='multiplequbits'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general however, a quantum computer does not consist of one qubit but many qubits interacting among each other. That is also where the power of quantum computer comes from! \n",
    "\n",
    "The state of an n-qubit system ($|\\psi>$) is given by the tensor product of the individual n-qubit state vectors and the basis set is given by the tensor product of the one qubit basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of basis states of a system increases with the number of qubits as $2^n$ (n=number qubits) and as such it can be fully described by a vector with $2^n$ entries. For example, for a system of 2-qubits each qubit can be in state |0> or |1>, this means that a 2-qubit system can be measured in states |00>, |01>, |10> or |11> (so all possible permutations). These are the basis states of the 2-qubit system. Before measuring, the 2-qubit system can be in any combination of these basis states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\psi> = \\alpha|00> + \\beta|01> +\\gamma|10> +\\delta|11>$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and the state $|\\psi>$ can be fully represented by the vector $[\\alpha, \\beta,\\gamma, \\delta]^T$ given the basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Modifying a quantum state <a id ='modifyingastate'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are a bit familiar with qubits, the next question is: how can we manipulate them? How can we modify the state of an n-qubit system? \n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying a quantum state means modifiying the probability amplitudes that describe it (the entries in the above vector). Measurments are a type of operation that do this. They \"turn\" all probability amplitudes to zero, except for one, which will have a value of 1.0 (basically they project the quantum state into one of the basis states). \n",
    "There are however many other operations that can modify the entries of such a vector and therefore of the quantum state of an n-qubit system. These operations (called quantum gates) can be used to manipulate the quantum state into a given outcome, we can use them to solve a problem. A quantum algorithm is just a sequence of gates with a given prupose. \n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum gate can be represented as $2^n$x$2^n$ unitary matrix (n the number of qubits in the system). The application of quantum gates to qubits corresponds to the multiplication of the n-qubit quantum state vector with the quantum gate matrix and results in a modification of the $2^n$ quantum state vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some gates are comparable to classical gates. For example the classical NOT gate can be compared to the quantum X gate. In classical computing the NOT-gate converts a 0 into a 1 and a 1 into a 0. The quantum X-gate swaps the probability amplitudes of both states and converts $|\\psi> = \\alpha |0> + \\beta|1>$ into $|\\psi>= \\beta|0> + \\alpha|0>$, which basically means the probability of measuring 0 or 1 is swap when we apply the X gate.\n",
    "For more examples of quantum gates we refer the reader to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate. For a more indepth knowledge of quantum gates we recommend for example: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.2998.pdf. How these gates are physically implemented depends on the type of qubits: superconductors, trapped ions, NV centers, photons, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most quantum gates act only in a small number of qubits (mostly due to experimental limitations).This is not a limitation as there exist sets of one- and two-qubit quantum gates which are universal for quantum computation: any operation possible on a quantum computer can be reduced to this set of gates. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Quantum circuits <a id ='quantumcircuits'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us here introduce shortly the notion of quantum circuits. They are graphical representations of a quantum algorithm, read from the left to the right. On the very left, the individual qubits, the quantum registers can be found written under each other.  From there on to the right, there is a line, called a wire, that describes the evolution of the register during computation.  On this wire, one can apply unitary operations at a certain point, by means of quantum gates. Finally, the state is measured.\n",
