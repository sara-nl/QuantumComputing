On the very left, the individual qubits, the quantum registers can be found written under each other. From there on to the right, there is a line, called a wire, that describes the evolution of the register during computation. On this wire, one can apply unitary operations at a certain point, by means of quantum gates. Finally, the state is measured.\n"
