If a 1-qubit gate is applied locally on one of two qubits, we can write this
as a 2-qubit unitary
If a 2-qubit gate is applied locally on qubits 1 and 3, we can write this as
a 3-qubit unitary: 
Quantum algorithm
A quantum algorithm is an infinite family C1, C2, . . . of quantum
circuits, where Cn acts on n qubits and consists of a finite sequence of
1-qubit and 2-qubit gates: Cn = (U1, U2, . . . , UL(n)) where L(n) denotes
the number of gates in the circuit. The map n â†’ Cn must be efficiently
computable (e.g., in polynomial time on a deterministic Turing machine).
